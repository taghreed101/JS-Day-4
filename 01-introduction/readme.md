# Introduction

The purpose of these lessons is to explore the features of JavaScript from the perspective of Ruby.  If you are not already familiar with Ruby, much of what you will find here will not make sense.

Likewise, we will not be exploring all of the features that JavaScript provides.  All of client-side JavaScript has been ignored, as there is no comparable feature in Ruby.

After finishing these lessons, you will be familiar with the basic syntax and core features of JavaScript, and you should be able to recognize and articulate key points of differentiation from Ruby.

Throughout these lessons, you may evaluate the expressions using the the nodeJS's REPL mode by typing in the terminal:
```bash
node
```

or you may also use the [browser's console](http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers) to experiment with the examples given.

Please do refer to the outside sources provided via the references section (at the bottom of each page).  There is a lot of great reading out there, and it would be ridiculous to assume that we could provide an adequate treatment of these topics in these pages alone.  Use the reading.  Do your own exploring and experimenting and playing around with the console.

[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript): always a good source for specific, practical questions. <br>
[Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/): not as heavy on the explanation side, but there are some decent tutorials to peruse if you feel like stretching your JS muscles a little further.
