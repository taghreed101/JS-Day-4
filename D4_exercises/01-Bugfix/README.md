## Background & Objectives

A new piece of knowledge to start the day! 

This is an exercise on how to work with multiple files in a frontend project. You'll find two javascript files in the `lib` folder. The code is currently broken, and your job is to fix it.

## Setup

Launch your local server with:

```bash
rake webpack
```

Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser, open your console and read the error message.

## Release 1

Until now you have always worked with one independent JS file. This is an exercise in how you can work with multiple.

Requirements:
1. Do not modify index.html
2. Do not copy the contents of one js to the other (merge them)

Hint: You would want to import / export the files. Familiarise yourself with the syntax as per (this site)[https://alligator.io/js/modules-es6/]

Go ahead and fix what you can! When it's done you should see Recode's logo displayed in your browser!
